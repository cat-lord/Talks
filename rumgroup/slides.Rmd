#  Using R as a GIS
- R packages include many functions that can be used for reading, writing, manipulating, analysing and modelling spatial data ([Bivand 2017](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html))
- The [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) R package is used to handle vector data and the [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) package for manipulating gridded spatial data
- Many R packages bundle boundary data like [tigris](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/index.html), [rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/index.html) and [osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/index.html), whilst [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html) and [spData](https://github.com/Nowosad/spData) include datasets for spatial analysis
- Spatial data are commonly visualised in R using [leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/index.html), [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html), [mapview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapview/index.html), [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) and [rasterVis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterVis/index.html) packages
- R interfaces with proprietary and open source GIS software like ArcGIS ([arcgisbinding](https://r-arcgis.github.io/assets/arcgisbinding.pdf)) and QGIS ([RQGIS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQGIS/index.html))

# The sf package
- intended to (eventually) replace the [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) package
- provides support for [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features), a formal standard used in spatial databases (e.g. [PostGIS](http://postgis.net)) and GIS software (e.g. [ESRI's ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com)).
- can perform geometric operations by interfacing with [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos)
- can read and write to most vector and raster spatial data formats using [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org)
- sits within the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) framework:
    - adopts pipe-friendly functions
    - stores attribute data and feature geometries in manipulable data frames
